- You can't make local variable - static
- Static class will be called on the time of class loading
- static blocks will run from top to bottom in numbering
- instance method belongs to instance and static method belongs to class
- within the same class, we can access static method directly or with classname( we can also call static method with object reference but it is not recommended )
- we can't use this and super in static block
- we can only access static member inside static method
- can't create static constructors
- why main method is static?
  -> so that JVM can call it without obj
