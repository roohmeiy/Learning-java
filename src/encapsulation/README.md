# Encapsulation
- Mechanism of data hiding
- Achieved using private modifiers
- Combines two key principles:
    1. Data Hiding
    2. Abstraction
- Public getter and setter methods
- atleast 1 parameterized constructor
- Follows standard Java Bean conventions

##  Class Types

### POJO (Plain Old Java Object) Class
- Simple Java class with minimal restrictions
- No special constraints or dependencies
- Not inherently compatible with specific frameworks
- Typically used for basic data representation

### Bean Class (by )
#### Data Components
- **Data Part**:
    - Private variables for data encapsulation
    - Access controlled through specific methods

- **Getter Methods**:
    - Used to retrieve values of private variables
    - Provide controlled access to class data

- **Setter Methods**:
    - Used to initialize or modify values of private variables
    - Provide controlled way to set class data
