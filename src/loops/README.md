##  Comparison
- .equals()    -> Content comparison     -> Strings 
- equalsIgnoreCase() -> Case-insensitive comparison -> Strings 
```java
string1.equals(string2)
```
if u use nextLine() after nextInt() ->  [ next int leave a \n after that so u need to write nextLine() before taking any string input So that nextLine() will not take \n leave by the nextInt() as input].
